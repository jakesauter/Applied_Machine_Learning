abstract = {Evaluating the success of prediction and retrieval systems depends upon a reliable reference standard, a ground truth. The ideal gold standard is expected to result from the marking, labeling, and rating of domain experts. However experts disagree and lack of agreement challenges the development and evaluation of image-based feature prediction. This paper addresses the success and limitations in bridging the semantic gap between CT-based pulmonary nodule image features and radiologistsâ€™ ratings of diagnostic characteristics. The prediction of diagnostic characteristics promises to automatically annotate images with medically meaningful descriptions usable for indexing and retrieving in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and computer aided diagnosis (CADx). Successful results in predicting texture characteristics will be contrasted with less successful results for boundary shapes. The two primary differences in agreement between radiologists will be discussed; the first concerns agreement about the existence of a nodule, while the second considers the variability in radiologistsâ€™ ratings.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper uses an ensemble of classifiers and active learning strategies to predict radiologists’ assessment of the nodules of the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). In particular, the paper presents machine learning classifiers that model agreement among ratings in seven semantic characteristics: spiculation, lobulation, texture, sphericity, margin, subtlety, and malignancy. The ensemble of classifiers (which can be considered as a computer panel of experts) uses 64 image features of the nodules across four categories (shape, intensity, texture, and size) to predict semantic characteristics. The active learning begins the training phase with nodules on which radiologists’ semantic ratings agree, and incrementally learns how to classify nodules on which the radiologists do not agree. Using our proposed approach, the classification accuracy of the ensemble of classifiers is higher than the accuracy of a single classifier. In the long run, our proposed approach can be used to increase consistency among radiological interpretations by providing physicians a “second read”.},

abstract="Lung cancer is pointed as the major cause of death among patients with cancer throughout the world. This work is intended to develop a methodology for diagnosis of lung nodules using images from the Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI). The proposed methodology uses image processing and pattern recognition techniques. In order to differentiate between the patterns of malignant and benign nodules, we used phylogenetic diversity by means of particular indexes, that are: intensive quadratic entropy, extensive quadratic entropy, average taxonomic distinctness, total taxonomic distinctness, and pure diversity indexes. After that, we applied the genetic algorithm for selection of the best model. In the tests' stage, we applied the proposed methodology to 1405 (394 malignant and 1011 benign) nodules. The proposed work presents promising results at the classification into malignant and benign, achieving accuracy of 92.52{\%}, sensitivity of 93.1{\%} and specificity of 92.26{\%}. The results demonstrated a good rate of correct detections using texture features. Since a precocious detection allows a faster therapeutic intervention, thus a more favorable prognostic to the patient, we propose herein a methodology that contributes to the area in this aspect.",

abstract = "To stimulate the advancement of computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) research for lung nodules in thoracic computed tomography (CT), the National Cancer Institute launched a cooperative effort known as the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). The LIDC is composed of five academic institutions from across the United States that are working together to develop an image database that will serve as an international research resource for the development, training, and evaluation of CAD methods in the detection of lung nodules on CT scans. Prior to the collection of CT images and associated patient data, the LIDC has been engaged in a consensus process to identify, address, and resolve a host of challenging technical and clinical issues to provide a solid foundation for a scientifically robust database. These issues include the establishment of (a) a governing mission statement, (b) criteria to determine whether a CT scan is eligible for inclusion in the database, (c) an appropriate definition of the term qualifying nodule, (d) an appropriate definition of {"}truth{"} requirements, (e) a process model through which the database will be populated, and (f) a statistical framework to guide the application of assessment methods by users of the database. Through a consensus process in which careful planning and proper consideration of fundamental issues have been emphasized, the LIDC database is expected to provide a powerful resource for the medical imaging research community. This article is intended to share with the community the breadth and depth of these key issues.",
